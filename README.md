# Day 1

🎯 Day 1: 1 Project a Day Until I Get Hired

 🧩 Excel Interactive Sales Dashboard

Today marks the start of my personal challenge: build one data project every day until I land a job in data analysis. I’m doing this to sharpen my skills, stay visible, and keep momentum going. I’m giving myself 1–2 hours daily to build something practical, insightful, or just fun.



For Day 1, I created an interactive sales dashboard in Excel using pivot tables, slicers, and charts. It allows filtering by:

- Region

- Product Category

- Customer Segment

- Order Date (via timeline)



The data is visualized across multiple dimensions like monthly trends, category distribution, and segment performance per year.

My focus was on clarity, interactivity, and usability — all built in Excel, in under an hour. 💡



🛠️ Tools used: Excel (PivotTables, Slicers, Charts, Timelines)

Open to feedback, collaboration, or opportunities. Let’s see where this journey leads!
